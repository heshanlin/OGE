Installation
------------

1) Configure package

If configure does not exist, first generate it with autoreconf.
$ mkdir m4
$ autoreconf -i

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install-dir

2) Make the package
$ make
$ make install

3) Add executable path to your $PATH environment variable.
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/install-dir/bin

Data Management
---------------

Users need to choose a root directory for an OGE data repository. An OGE application will initialize the root directory if it has not been initialized. A pre-configured OGE repository is distributed under the ogeroot/ directory in the package. There are two important configuration files in a OGE repository.

1) oge.ini
This file stores important system parameters, such as debugging configuration and the temporary execution directory.

2) catalog.xml
This file stores meta information of all plug-ins and workflows in the repository.

By defaults, plug-in definitations are stored under plugins/ and workflow definiations are stored under workflows/. Note that the actual applications are not included in the package. Users need to download these applications from their original websites. 

Getting Started
---------------

OGE can be accessed through three approaches.

1) Command Line Interface (CLI)

There is a cli.py located in the cli/ dir. To launch it:

python cli/cli.py ogeroot/

Once the CLI is stared, type help to see all the supported commands. It provides a menu-driven tool to help user create workflows.

2) Programmable Interface

An example of how to use programmable interface to access OGE is given in examples/c++/align_workflow.cpp.

3) Annoated Script Interface

OGE provides a tool called import_script to import BPipe-like annotated scripts. This tool will parse the input script and automatically generate plug-ins and workflows. An example of the annotated script is given in examples/annotated_scripts/script_example. To import from a script:

import_script <oge_root> <script>

Please refer to the user manual (manual/OGEUserManual.pdf) for more information.
