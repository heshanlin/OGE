Installation
------------

1) ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install-dir
2) make
3) make install
4) Add executable path to your $PATH environment variable.
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/install-dir/bin

Data Management
---------------

Users need to choose a root directory for OGE. An OGE application will initialize the root directory at the first run. There are two important configuration files in the OGE root. 

1) ctc.ini
This file stores important system parameters, such as debugging configuration and the temporary execution directory.

2) catalog.xml
This file stores meta information of all plugins and workflows in the repository.

By defaults, plugin definitations are stored under plugins/ and workflow definiations are stored under workflows/.

A pre-configured OGE root is stored in test/ with several widely used plugins and workflows defined.

Getting Started
---------------

OGE can be accessed through three approaches.

1) Command Line Interface

There is a cli.py located in the cli/ dir. To use it:

python cli/cli.py <oge_root>

Once the cli is stared, type help to see all the supported commands. It provides a menu-driven tool to help user create the workflow.

2) Programmable interface

An example of how to use programmable interface to access OGE is given in examples/c++/align_workflow.cpp.

3) BPipe-like script parsing. 

OGE provides a tool called import_script to import BPipe-like annotated scripts. This tool will parse the input script and automatically generate plugins and workflows. An example of the annotated script is given in examples/annotated_scripts/script_example. To import from a script:

import_script <oge_root> <script>
